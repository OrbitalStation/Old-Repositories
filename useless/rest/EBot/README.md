### Telegram Email Messaging Bot (EBot)
The goal of this bot is to send any forwarded to it
messages onto given email whilst providing info about sender,
such as date/time of writing, chat and, of course,
the original message.

It can also automatically upload attachments(photo, docs,
audio, etc.) onto given Google Drive or Yandex Disk
and provide link in the email.

### How to use the bot
There is an instance of the bot that is running 24/7 on a remote server.
